Events as a business was fairly traditional in terms of marketing, but through Tag Digital capitalising on this niche with few competitors, we are bringing digital marketing to the world of events and disrupting the norm. We support events organisers using digital advertising campaigns on Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Bing and YouTube, which are our base PPC platforms to overcome the challenges that our clients face and to supercharge their event attendance. PPC is highly trackable, one of the only marketing channels that tells you with certainty how much it costs to get one attendee or sponsor. You can use event PPC campaigns to promote and advertise your event to a largely untapped audience who is searching for information that your event provides. We use keyword, audience and behavioural targeting to identify users who may be interested in client events and then market the appropriate ads to them. We interpret thousands of data sets to determine the best approach, working with budgets up to £500,000. We can confidently allocate budget to platforms we know will perform best, as well as project results before starting a campaign. We fully understand how to pace budgets, when to spend on geos, factoring in price breaks, the value of new data or quality data for organisers. In addition, Tag Digital have built a data benchmarking tool using 100,000 campaigns, enabling us to project with accuracy the cost per acquisition for any sector or country. We can typically achieve a benchmark of around 30% of clients' overall results, which greatly exceeds the standard 2-4% delivered through in-house digital marketing. In 2018 Tag Digital ran highly targeted digital marketing campaigns for over 2000 events, for world leading organisers including Informa, GES, The Telegraph, The Financial Times, Messe Frankfurt and many more. By running campaigns in over 40 countries across all sectors, time zones and currencies, Tag Digital is on a mission to educate and support the world of events on how PPC can immediately increase your event ROI.</p>","categories":[19857,19859,19865,19866,19870,19873,19876,19877,19879,19881],"country":"United Kingdom","address":"2 Eastbourne Terrace","city":"London","zip":"W2 6LG","phone1":"+44 207 310 8545","email":"info@tagdigital.co.uk","website":"https://tagdigital.co.uk/","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/tagdigitaluk/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/tagdigitaluk"},{"id":124191,"externalId":"the-tekk-grouptablet-hire","name":"The Tekk Group & Tablet Hire","logo":"exhibitors/124191/media/the-tekk-grouptablet-hire.png?v=138318","description":"<p>We are The Tekk Group &amp; Tablet Hire.
